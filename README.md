# Quote Generator
This webpage lets you look at quotes and will generate a new quote every time you request one.
I used plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this project. I also used an API to randomly fetch a quote, Hero Patterns for the background, and Font Awesome for the icons.

### Resources
Font Awesome: https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&q=close&m=free
